#### Does not currently work, as the cell array is sorted incorrectly in the cgns file from ansys ####

"Quick" way to convert meshes created in ANSYS to one thats useable in FEniCS. 
I could not find a working way to do this, so this document hopefully shows up in relevant google searches.

1) Export the mesh as a .cgns file.

2) Import the .cgns to Salome.

3) Use the "Split Volumes" tool to convert all prism layers to tetrahedrons. (generated by "inflation layers" in ANSYS)

4) Use the "Scale Transform" tool to scale down the model original scale, as Salome scales it up by 10^3 if your geometry is created in millimeters.
   Check "Whole mesh", set appropriate scale-factor i.e. 0.001, check "create a new mesh" and *IMPORTANT* check "Generate groups" so conserve the named
   boundaries.
   
   
5) Export the files as a .med file, and run the "convertMEDToXDMF.py" script. This will assign an integer to defined boundaries instead of a string. Make
   sure to inspect this visually in Paraview.

6) Import to mesh as shown in the example script "FEniCS_import.py".

Hope this is helpfull to somebody!
